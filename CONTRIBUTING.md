## Contributing

Contributions to Scanpy are highly welcome!

* We stick to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) and to this [editorconfig](https://github.com/theislab/scanpy/blob/master/.editorconfig) and *try* to stick to 80-character lines. In some cases, wider lines might improve readability, in most cases, not. Docstrings should always be 80 characters.
* We use the numpydoc style for writing docstrings. Either take a look at any Scanpy or Numpy function or [here](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_numpy.html). The `Params` abbreviation is a legit replacement for `Parameters`.
* Write tests for your functions! See [here](https://github.com/theislab/scanpy/tree/master/scanpy/tests) for examples.
